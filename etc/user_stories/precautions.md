# Precautions

## **User Story**
As a **User**
I want **a safe way to exchange my goods**
So that **I dont get harmed by other users**

## **Acceptance Criteria
All accounts are athenticated to prevent malicious actors
Only suggest safe meetup spots with a 3rd "mediator"
Report feature for those who abuse the system

## **Notes**
Implement a system where a 3rd random person is needed for the meetup (they will gain credits of some sort)
Prevent users from creating new fake accounts after they get banned
