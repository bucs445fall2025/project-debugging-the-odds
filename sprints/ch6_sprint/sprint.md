### The summary of the entire project

The purpose of this application is to give users the ability to trade (barter) real life items rather than using money. This facilitates the gift economy and gives a platform to people who want to trade real life items (Like pokemon cards). Our project is marketed to broke college kids, middle aged parents, and Gen X who use NextDoor or Buy Nothing Facebook groups.
