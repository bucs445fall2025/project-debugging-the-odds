### The summary of the entire project

- The purpose of this application is to give users the ability to trade (barter) real life items rather than using money. This facilitates the gift economy and gives a platform to people who want to trade real life items (Like pokemon cards). Our project is marketed to broke college kids, middle aged parents, and Gen X who use NextDoor or Buy Nothing Facebook groups.
